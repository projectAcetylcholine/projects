## What is project AcetylCholine?
The primary object of the Microsoft organization is to enable every person, developer and organization to succeed. Several developers and organizations from time to time face challenges with understanding what is possible, deploying OSS data workloads on Azure and integrating OSS data workloads with Azure Platform data solutions.

AcetylCholine is a community effort to close gaps that currently exists in awareness, deployment options as well as integration options between Open Source data projects and the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

We are currently targetting the following open source data projects in our initial efforts

- Apache Kafka
