## What is project AcetylCholine?
The primary object of the Microsoft organization is to enable every person, developer and organization to succeed. Several developers and organizations from time to time face challenges with understanding what is possible, deploying OSS data workloads on Azure and integrating OSS data workloads with Azure Platform data solutions.
