This is used to track the status of issues and tasks within project AcetylCholine.

## What is project AcetylCholine?
The primary objective of the Microsoft organization is to enable every person, developer and organization to succeed. Several developers and organizations from time to time face challenges with understanding what is possible, deploying OSS data workloads on Azure and integrating OSS data workloads with Azure Platform data solutions.
