# project AcetylCholine
This is used to track the status of issues and tasks within project AcetylCholine.

## What is project AcetylCholine?
The primary objective of the Microsoft organization is to enable every person, developer and organization to succeed. Several developers and organizations from time to time face challenges with understanding what is possible, deploying OSS data workloads on Azure and integrating OSS data workloads with Azure Platform data solutions.

Protect AcetylCholine is a community-driven initiative in an effort to close gaps that currently exists in awareness, deployment options as well as integration options between Open Source data projects and the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

## Why the name AcetylCholine?
![AcetylCholine](acetylcholine.jpg "AcetylCholine")

Acetylcholine is the chief neurotransmitter of a branch of the peripheral nervous system responsible for contracting smooth muscles, dilating blood vessels and slowing our heart rates. In our nervous system there are neurons that transport signals from point to point but there are gaps known as synapses between these neurons. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that helps bridge these gaps and allows for these signals to still be transmitted from neuron to neuron to and from the brain and spinal cord despite the presense of these gaps (synapses). This project was design to close any gaps that exist between the goals of our current and prospective partners/customers and the current awareness, deployment and integration options between key OSS projects focused on Event-Driven Architectures and the Microsoft Azure platform.

## What projects is AcetylCholine currently focused on?
We are currently targetting the following open source data projects in our initial efforts

- Apache Kafka 
- Apache Flink
- Apache Pulsar
- Apache Beam

## Are there any JIRA Issues or Links Tracking Some of These Work

For the Apache Kafka project, we are currently working on the following issues:
- [KAFKA-12458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12458) Integration Azure Storage (Blob and ADLS Gen2) with KIP-405 Kafka Tiered Storage implementation. Details of how the plugin can be downloaded and installed will be available soon.

For the Apache Flink project, several JIRA issues are available to track upcoming integrations
