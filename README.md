# project AcetylCholine
This is used to track the status of issues and tasks within project AcetylCholine.

## What is project AcetylCholine?
The primary objective of the Microsoft organization is to enable every person, developer and organization to succeed. Several developers and organizations from time to time face challenges with understanding what is possible, deploying OSS data workloads on Azure and integrating OSS data workloads with Azure Platform data solutions.

Protect AcetylCholine is a community-driven initiative in an effort to close gaps that currently exists in awareness, deployment options as well as integration options between Open Source data projects and the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.

## What projects is AcetylCholine currently focused on?
We are currently targetting the following open source data projects in our initial efforts

- Apache Kafka 
- Apache Flink
- Apache Pulsar
- Apache Beam
